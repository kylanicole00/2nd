            a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology, which allows me to 
            explore my passion for tech and develop skills in programming, I I
            enjoy programming and have a general interest in emerging technology
            and IT. I find it rewarding to apply technical skills to solve
            problems, whether they're big or small.
